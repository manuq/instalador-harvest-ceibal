# Attempt to pin the internal wifi device with name eth0
# Some components expect the internal device to have name 'eth0', but this
# can sometimes change when external networking devices are connected.
#
# Note that this file needs to present in both olpc-utils and the initramfs.
# These rules can also be executed twice, both times as if the interface
# is new: in the activation initramfs, then in regular boot.
